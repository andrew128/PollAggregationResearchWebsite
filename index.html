                    <h1>Poll Aggregation</h1>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Introduction:</strong>
                        Poll aggregation can be thought of as an extension to polling. 
                        Poll aggregators combine multiple polls in a certain way to get a better estimate than a single poll can do. 
                        It's like comparing a single data point to results drawn from multiple data points, such as an average. 
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>Two Categories of Poll Aggregators:</strong>
                        There are two main types of poll aggregators. 
                        The first type are those that look purely at the numbers given from polls with "relatively little additional processing" (PEC). 
                        The second type are aggregators that use the data from polls as well as a variety of predicative variables, such as the state of the economy. 
                        For example, if a certain demographic has been known to vote for a certain party after certain shifts in the economy, some of these aggregators will account for that. 
                        We will refer to aggregators dealing only with polls as "pure aggregators" and  predicative aggregators as "predictors". 
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>Goal:</strong>
                        The goal of my project is to determine whether predictors fare better than pure aggregators in the context of the 2016 Presidential Election and why. 
                        I will then try to see if any of the results/explanations can be generalized (senate races, sports competitions, etc.). 
                        I chose to cover the 2016 Presidential Election because it was well covered by the poll aggregators.

                        Let's compare four well-known poll aggregators. 
                        The first two, Huffington Post's Pollster and Real Clear Politics, only use the numbers from various polls. 
                        The second two, 538 and NYT's Upshot make predictions based on various variables.

                            Methodology:
                        </strong>
                        I compared the four polls by looking at their projected margins for the two main party candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the swing states in the electoral college.
                        I did this by taking the absolute value of the projected margin subtracted from the actual margin. 
                        I then averaged these differences to calculate the average error margin.
                        The results are shown below.

                    <p>
                        <strong>
                            Summary of Results:
                        </strong>
                        The four aggregators performed in a similar range; all scored within one percentage point of one another. 
                        Overall, the predictors performed better than the pure aggregators although the NYT's Upshot and the Huffington Post's Pollster differed by 0.03 percentage points.
                        538 did the best by a relatively significant margin; it scored approximately 0.4 percentage points away from the closet competitor, the NYT's Upshot.
                        <br/>
                        When comparing 538 (the best predictor) to Huffington Post's Pollster (the best pure aggregator), it's interesting to note that both predicted the vote share in the same direction in every single state although by slightly different margins. 
                        This could be because they might have used many of the same polls in their analysis, or they both could've made the same systematic error, such as underestimating the silent majority.

                        Because poll aggregating relies on polls, aggregators have all the problems that polls have in addition to problems created during aggregation. 
                        One type of problem comes from systematic errors, which are problems in the polling methodology. 
                        An example of a systematic error is the voter turnout of a poll's sample. 
                        The poll might have sampled a part of the population that might not actually vote in an election. 
                        <br />
                        From the results of the 2016 Presidential Election electoral college and the four aggregators covered, we see that predictors fared better than pure aggregators. 
                        We can not assume that this will be true in any sort of competition where polling is done because there is not enough data used to cover those areas. 
                        However, we can look at some comparisons to find reasons why some aggregators did better than others. 
                        <br /><br/>
                         <strong>
                        Aggregator Comparisons:
                        </strong>
                        Let's first compare the two pure aggregators, Huffington Post's Pollster and Real Clear Politics. Although Huffington Post doesn't give a detailed explanation of their methodology, they do some sort of statistical analysis that is more sophisticated than the simple averaging that Real Clear Politics does.
                        <br/>
                        Now let's compare the two predictors, 538 and the NYT's Upshot. Like Real Clear Politics, the NYT's Upshot takes an average of the polls it uses. This can be seen as a feature because, as more polls are taken into account over an election cycle, the average is less likely to change after recent polls. However, this means the Upshot will also be slow to predict developing trends. 
538 takes into account many different factors such as 3rd party candidates, national and state polling trends, and demographic and regional information. The result is that 538 changes much more often than the Upshot because it is constantly looking for new trends. 
                        <br/>
                        Now let's compare 538, the best predictor, and Huffington Post's Pollster, the best pure aggregator. Huffington Post's smoothing methodology is "not optimal for revealing sudden shifts", such as the effect of a debate (PEC). Beside that, Huffington Post does not reveal much about its methodology aside from a set of strict criteria for polls that it includes. 538 is similar to Huffington Post in standards of polls used. However, as 538 is a predictor, it also brings up many other predicative indicators that Huffington Post's purely mathematical models can't see. One example factor is demographics, and how 538 uses past data to predict how different demographics will vote. Accounting for these has set 538 ahead by a solid margin.  
                        <br/><br/>
                        <strong>
                            Circumstances That Potentially Favor Pure Aggregators Over Predictors:
                        </strong>
                        Looking at the reasons and methodology of all these aggregators, we can deduce some circumstances where pure aggregators might potentially do better than predictors. One circumstance is when there is a lot of high quality polls that are being done. Looking at the data from the swing states, we can see that both 538 and Huffington Post, the best aggregators in their respective categories, had the highest error margins in mid-west and southern states, particularly Nebraska, and North Carolina. Vox  recently reported that states in the south have closed down almost 900 polling places for the 2016 election, which would definitely affect all aggregators negatively. However, I think this will affect the pure aggregators even more because they only rely on these polls and not other predicative indicators. Having more data to analyze usually leads to more accurate predictions. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        <strong>
                            Why do we care about polling/poll aggregating? :
                        </strong>
                        A democracy relies on the people, and as a result there is a lot of trust put on the people to be well-educated and know what is best for themselves and the people around them. Not only should the people be well-educated, they should also be well-informed. Awareness of problems in our society is key to empathizing with people with different perspectives and providing solutions to those problems. I think that polls and poll aggregators can help inform the public. However, I think that they should not be taken to seriously, because as we've seen so far, the polls/poll aggregators can be off at key moments, such as the 2016 Presidential Election. All the poll aggregators I covered predicted a Clinton victory. In summary, I believe that polling and poll aggregating is inherently a good thing because it helps inform the general population. I also believe that we should not rely solely on polls to guide us.
